INTRODUCTION
  This is a command line client for streaming music from soundcloud. Timed
  comments are displayed on the command line as the playback reaches their
  respective positions.

EXAMPLES
  ./soundcli.rb stream http://soundcloud.com/rekado/the-human-song

SETUP
  soundCLI will save your authentication/refresh tokens (not your credentials)
  in a file, so you only need to provide your credentials once. The token file
  will be saved to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/soundcli.

  mkdir ~/.config/soundcli

DEPENDENCIES
  - gstreamer bindings for ruby (gst)
  - cURL bindings for ruby (curb)

BUGS
  - buffering doesn't work well
  - download only returns the download url but does not download yet
